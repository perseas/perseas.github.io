## Welcome to Perseas!

Perseas is a GitHub-based open-source organization that develops utilities to help with the management and maintenance of [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) databases.

Our flagship project is [Pyrseas](https://github.com/perseas/Pyrseas). This provides a utility to create a [YAML](http://yaml.org/)/JSON description of a Postgres database so that it can be stored and diff'ed in a version control repository. A second utility allows the YAML description to be compared to an actual Postgres database and to generate SQL data definition commands to synchronize the target database with the YAML.
